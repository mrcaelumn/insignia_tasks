## 5. Data Science Secret
- **Secret**: One thrilling secret in Data Science is that the majority of a data scientist's time (around 80%) is spent on data cleaning and preprocessing, rather than building models or analyzing results. This often comes as a surprise to many newcomers who expect to spend most of their time on model development.
